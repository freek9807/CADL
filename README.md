# README - Incremental Analysis
================================

This project is a proof of concept in a very early stages (see below
for TODOs and known issues) implementing the incremental approach
described in ...

## Requirement to build the project #

The project requires

- [OCaml](http://www.ocaml.org/) standard compilers and tools

- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) OCaml Package Manager (Forse anche no)

- Libreria per definire dei test? (Ounit?)


## Building the project #

Typing `make` will generate a `main` binary, that you can run:
```
$ make
$ ./main
```

## Project structure #

Here is a description of content of the repository

      src/           <-- source code lives here

      Makefile       <-- Driver for `make` (uses OCB)
      .merlin        <-- Merlin configuration
      _tags          <-- OCamlBuild configuration


## The source code

The `src/` directory defines things:
